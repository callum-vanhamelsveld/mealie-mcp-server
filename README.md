# Mealie MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes read-only tools for the Mealie recipe API. Designed to be launched on-demand via `npx` and communicate over stdio (standard input/output) with clients like AnythingLLM.

## Quick start

Prerequisites:
- Node.js (LTS) and npm
- Mealie base URL and API token

Environment variables:
- MEALIE_BASE_URL (e.g., http://mealie.local:9000)
- MEALIE_TOKEN (API token)

Run locally:
npx mealie-mcp-server

This placeholder will be replaced with the actual MCP server implementation in the next steps.
